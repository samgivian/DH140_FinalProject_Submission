### Topic 

Since the beginning of Covid-19, science and scientists have faced a lot of distrust and attacks from the public and even Congress. I was curious to see if Congress has historically relied on the experience and guidance of experts for help or not. Specifically, during times of crises like the financial crises of 2008 or the stagflation era of the 1980s, the 2001 terrorist attack, and the tech bubble of 2001. I also wanted to see whether our government relies more on the help of experts compared to the past as we have progressed and have more experts available to help us in making legislation. In this project, I examine the trend of different social scientist's testimony before Congress and their probable causes. This project also looks into the effect of the US political environment and the shift in the number of social scientists' testimonies over the years. Additionally, it finds out what issues Congress invites social scientists to testify.

### Questions answered in this project
1. What type of social scientists does Congress mostly invite to testify?
2. Has the number of social scientists appearing before Congress increased over time?
3. Does Congress being dominated by Republicans or Democrats affect the number of social scientists testifying?
4. Are there any trends in the subfields of social scientists who testify?
5. What type of social scientists testify the most, and what are the probable causes?
6. For what causes does Congress mostly invite social scientists to testify?
7. Are there any patterns between crises and the number of scientists testifying before Congress?
