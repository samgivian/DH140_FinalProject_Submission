# Examing social scientists appearance before Congress from 1946 to 2016

### Topic 

Since the beginning of Covid-19, science and scientists have faced a lot of distrust and attacks from the public and even congress. I was curious to see if congress has historically relied on experience and guidance of experts for help or not. In this project I'm trying observe trends between social scientists appearence before congress by year, party, type and events. I think as society we need to rely more on guidance of scientists as they have spent years studying and thinking how to solve our problems and congress could benefit from hearing what they have to say.
    
### Questions
1. What type of social scientists does congress mostly invite for testiomny?
2. Has the number of social scientists appearning before congress increased?
3. Are there any patterns between crises and number of scientists appearning between congress?
4. Does congress being dominated by republicans or democrates effect the number of social scientists appearning before congress?
5. What type of social scientists appear the most?
